# Assignment 1

**Collaborators: Theodora Athanitis **


### Problem 1 

Install the datasets package on the console below using `install.packages("datasets")`. Now load the library.

```{r}
#install.packages("datasets")
```

*Answer: Installed!*

Load the USArrests dataset and rename it `dat`. Note that this dataset comes with R, in the package datasets, so there's no need to load data from your computer. Why is it useful to rename the dataset?

```{r}
dat<-USArrests
```

Answer: Renaming data sets ensures that you do not edit any of your original data on accident, and it is also easier to type.

### Problem 2

Use this command to make the state names into a new variable called State. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat$state<-tolower(rownames(USArrests))
```

This dataset has the state names as row names, so we just want to make them into a new variable. We also make them all lower case, because that will help us draw a map later - the map function requires the states to be lower case.


List the variables contained in the dataset `USArrests`.

```{r}
names(dat)
```
*Answer: The variables are Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, and Rape, in addition to the new variable that we just created, state.*

### Problem 3 

What type of variable (from the DVB chapter) is `Murder`? 

*Answer: Murder is a quantitative variable according to the DVB chapter because we are measuring the amount of murder arrests per 100,000.*

What R Type of variable is it?

*Answer: In R, the data points in the Murder column are numeric variables. However, the object itself is identified as a character, as seen below*

```{r}
typeof("Murder")
```

### Problem 4

What information is contained in this dataset, in general? What do the numbers mean? 

```{r}
head(dat)
```

*Answer: Generally, this dataset contains rates for specific crime arrests per 100,000 people, as well as percentages of urban population per state. The numbers are equivalent to the calculated arrest rates for Murder, Assault, and Rape. The Urban Population numbers are the percentages of the population in each state that live in an urban area.*

### Problem 5

Draw a histogram of `Murder` with proper labels and title.

```{r}
hist(dat$Murder, xlab = "Murder Arrests per 100,000 People", main = "Frequency of Murder Arrest Rates in the US", col = "purple")
```


### Problem 6

Please summarize `Murder` quantitatively. What are its mean and median? What is the difference between mean and median? What is a quartile, and why do you think R gives you the 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu.?



```{r}

```

### Problem 7

Repeat the same steps you followed for `Murder`, for the variables `Assault` and `Rape`. Now plot all three histograms together. You can do this by using the command `par(mfrow=c(3,1))` and then plotting each of the three. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 8}

```

What does the command par do, in your own words (you can look this up by asking R `?par`)?

Answer:

What can you learn from plotting the histograms together?

Answer:
  
### Problem 8

In the console below (not in text), type `install.packages("maps")` and press Enter, and then type `install.packages("ggplot2")` and press Enter. This will install the packages so you can load the libraries.

Run this code:

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 4}
library('maps') 
library('ggplot2') 

ggplot(dat, aes(map_id=state, fill=Murder)) + 
  geom_map(map=map_data("state")) + 
  expand_limits(x=map_data("state")$long, y=map_data("state")$lat)
```

What does this code do? Explain what each line is doing.
